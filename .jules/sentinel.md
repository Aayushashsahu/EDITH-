## 2024-05-28 - [Command Injection via Windows CMD Bridge]
**Vulnerability:** Command injection vulnerability in WSL-to-Windows `_cmd` execution bridge when untrusted input (e.g., URLs) is passed to `WIN_CMD /c start {url}` without sanitization.
**Learning:** `cmd.exe` easily executes injected commands (via `&` or `&&`), making naive string interpolation extremely dangerous when crossing the OS boundary from WSL to Windows.
**Prevention:** Avoid `_cmd` for untrusted input. Instead, use the PowerShell bridge (`_ps`), enclose inputs strictly in single quotes, and escape any internal single quotes (`replace("'", "''")`) to ensure literal string evaluation.

## 2025-02-12 - Prevent Host Command Injection in Remote Execution with Pipes
**Vulnerability:** The ADB integration used `shell=True` to execute `adb` commands to allow piping logic on the Android device (e.g., `dumpsys | grep`), which introduced a critical command injection vulnerability on the host machine.
**Learning:** We need to support shell-like pipelines on remote systems while keeping execution completely secure and avoiding injection attacks on the host. Standard `shlex.split` cannot parse pipeline operators correctly without stripping them or breaking execution locally.
**Prevention:** Remove `shell=True` completely. For executing complex commands with pipes on remote environments like `adb shell`, construct the arguments list by prefixing the remote command string as a single, cohesive argument to `shell` (e.g., `["adb", "-s", IP, "shell", "dumpsys | grep"]`). This avoids host shell parsing while correctly passing the piped command strictly to the remote shell.
## 2026-07-28 - [Timing Attack Risk in API Key Verification]
**Vulnerability:** Standard equality operators (== and !=) were used to verify API keys in HTTP and WebSocket endpoints, making them susceptible to timing attacks.
**Learning:** Using == to compare secrets leaks information about the secret's length and content, as it short-circuits upon the first mismatch.
**Prevention:** Always use secrets.compare_digest (and ensure both inputs are strings, not None) when comparing secrets like API keys, tokens, or passwords.

## 2026-08-01 - [Attribute-based XSS in Frontend Templates]
**Vulnerability:** The custom `esc()` utility used in `frontend/templates/index.html` failed to escape single (`'`) and double (`"`) quotes. This introduced attribute-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities when untrusted strings were injected into element attributes using `innerHTML` or template literals (e.g., `aria-label="${esc(t.title)}"`).
**Learning:** Escaping only HTML tags (`<`, `>`, `&`) is insufficient for data that will be placed inside element attributes wrapped in quotes. An attacker can use matching quotes to break out of the attribute context and inject arbitrary JavaScript via event handlers (e.g., `onload` or `onclick`).
**Prevention:** Always explicitly escape single quotes (`&#39;`) and double quotes (`&quot;`) alongside standard HTML entities in vanilla JS serialization functions to secure property assignments within `innerHTML` bindings.
