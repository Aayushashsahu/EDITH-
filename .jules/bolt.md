## 2024-05-30 - Caching Kokoro KPipeline Instance
**Learning:** Instantiating heavy ML pipelines like `KPipeline` on every method call introduces severe latency bottlenecks. Profiling the TTS engine revealed that this pattern severely degrades performance for repeated invocations in an application aiming for near-real-time responsiveness.
**Action:** Implemented caching for the `KPipeline` object as a class attribute `self._kokoro_pipe` in `TTSEngine`. In the future, always inspect methods executing ML or deep-learning models to ensure the model instance is instantiated lazily once and reused.

## 2026-07-10 - Batched Concurrency for Embedding
**Learning:** List comprehensions with await evaluate sequentially, causing performance bottlenecks for I/O tasks. Aggressive concurrency overloads local Ollama instances.
**Action:** Replaced sequential await with `asyncio.gather` combined with chunking (batch size of 5) to balance speed and system load.
